# Undercover

A very simple chrome extension built with privacy in mind that allows you to automatically browse privately based off of a domain.

Anonymous browsing by domain has never been easier - Just click on the Undercover icon, add the domain you wish to redirect to an incognito tab and select weather you'd like to automatically close the non-incognito tab and that's it.
